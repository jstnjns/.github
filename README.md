# Justin Jones â€” @jstnjns

I'm Justin, a lot of people just call me Jones.  I work with the wonderful people at [MasterClass](http://masterclass.com/) building teams, tools, and tools for teams.  On the side I like to [cook](http://instagram.com/jstnjns), hack on [home automation projects](http://github.com/jstnjns/ottto), and build real things with wood, metal, and concrete.
